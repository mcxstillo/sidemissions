# SideMissions
   Sidemissions aims to provide a platform where users can find different kinds of quick jobs to allow users to gain additional revenue.
   This will benefit the people who are looking to get extra income from the comfort of their own homes or from their own skills.

## Prerequisites
To set up the local web application, download and install the following modules: 

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

## Installing
To run the server, open up the command prompt and navigate through the folder where the files are contained. To create the node modules, use the command 
  - npm install express
  - npm i express
  - npm i body-parser
  - npm i cookie-parser
  - npm i session
  - npm i express-session
  - npm i hbs
  - npm i moongose
  - npm i nodemon(*optional)

to start the server, use the command

            node index.js
            
Lastly, on your browser (the members use Google Chrome), enter the url

            localhost:3000

## Running the tests
Once the server is running, it will be available at localhost:3000. This will show the homepage of the web application where you are chosen between logging in or registering a new account.

To register, fill out the necessary input text fields in the form and press the "Register" button. You may then proceed to log in with the email and password.

If you chose to Login first, you may enter any of the credentials below:
| E-mail | Password |
| --- | --- |

Once logged in, you will be redirected to a different version of the homepage only visible to logged in users. The page will now have legit routes assigned to navigation buttons such as the categories for quick searches based on categories. The jumbotron will also have a giant search bar for the user to enter any query they wish to look for. The cards seen on the bottom of the page contains navigation links to other parts of the page such as creating a job, viewing the current user's profile, and viewing their mission log. From this page, the next step is up to the preference of the user depending on what they wish to do.

#### Create Mission
For a user to create a mission, you must provide a title, description, and the supporting details such as duration and payment. Users can also edit missions they have posted should the need to update contents arise. This can be accessed through a button on the right side of the page when a user views a mission they have posted.

#### Apply for Mission
When you have found a job you wish to do, you can apply by clicking on the 'Apply for mission' button found below the information of the mission handler.

### Delete Mission
You may delete any posts you have made by clicking on the trash can found in the manage posts interface.

#### Edit Profile
You may edit your profile information such as description and contact information. To do so, click on your name on the upper right of any page and click on the edit profile button found on the upper right of the profile.
